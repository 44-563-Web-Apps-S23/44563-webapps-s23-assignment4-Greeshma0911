            _The Diabolical Circle_ is reprinted by special permission of Professor
            Franz Rickaby, in whose course in dramatic composition (English 36) in
            the University of North Dakota this play was written. For permission to
            perform, address Professor Franz Rickaby, University of North Dakota,
            University, North Dakota.
            
            
            BEULAH BORNSTEAD
            
            Beulah Bornstead, one of the promising young playwrights of the
            Northwest, was born in Grand Forks, North Dakota, May 5, 1896. She has
            had her academic training at the University of North Dakota, from which
            she received her B.A. in 1921. At present Miss Bornstead is principal of
            the Cavalier High School, North Dakota. Before attempting drama she
            tried her hand at journalism and at short-story writing.
            
            Miss Bornstead was introduced into playwriting by Professor Franz
            Rickaby, in whose course in dramatic composition at the University of
            North Dakota _The Diabolical Circle_ was written. In speaking of this
            play Miss Bornstead writes: "_The Diabolical Circle_ is the first play I
            have ever written. I never enjoyed doing anything so much in my life.
            The characters were so real to me that if I had bumped into one going
            round the corner I should not have been surprised in the least. BETTY
            and CHARLES and ADONIJAH and even COTTON MATHER himself worked that play
            out. All the humble author did was to set it down on paper." _The
            Diabolical Circle_ was produced May 5, 1921, by the Dakota Playmakers in
            their Little Theatre at the University of North Dakota.
            
            _The Diabolical Circle_ is one of the best contemporary plays dealing
            with American historical material. Its characterization is one of its
            noteworthy elements.
            
            
            CHARACTERS
            
                COTTON MATHER
                BETTY, _his daughter_
                ADONIJAH WIGGLESWORTH, _a suitor, and_ COTTON'S _choice_
                CHARLES MANNING, _likewise a suitor, but_ BETTY'S _choice_
                THE CLOCK
            
            
            
            
            THE DIABOLICAL CIRCLE
            
            
                 SCENE: _The living-room in the Mather home in Boston._
            
                 TIME: _About 1700, an evening in early autumn._
            
                 _The stage represents the living-room of the Mather home. A large
                 colonial fireplace is seen down-stage left, within which stand huge
                 brass andirons. To one side hangs the bellows, with the tongs near
                 by, while above, underneath the mantelpiece, is suspended an old
                 flint-lock rifle. On both ends of the mantel are brass
                 candlesticks, and hanging directly above is an old-fashioned
                 portrait of Betty's mother. There are two doors, one leading into
                 the hall at centre left, the other, communicating with the rest of
                 the house, up-stage right. A straight high-backed settee is
                 down-stage right, while in the centre back towers an old
                 grandfather's clock.[K] To the left of the clock is the window,
                 cross-barred and draped with flowered chintz. An old-fashioned
                 table occupies the corner between the window and the hall door.
                 Here and there are various straight-backed chairs of Dutch origin.
                 Rag rugs cover the floor._
            
                 _As the curtain rises_ COTTON MATHER _is seated in a large armchair
                 by the fire, with_ BETTY _on a stool at his feet, with her
                 knitting_.
            
                 COTTON, _his hair already touched with the whitening frost of many
                 a severe New England winter, is grave and sedate. Very much
                 exercised with the perils of this life, and serenely contemplative
                 of the life to come, he takes himself and the world about him very
                 seriously._
            
                 _Not so with_ MISTRESS BETTY. _Outwardly demure, yet inwardly
                 rebellious against the straitened conventions of the times, she
                 dimples over with roguish merriment upon the slightest
                 provocation._
            
                 _As we first see them_ COTTON _is giving_ BETTY _some timely
                 advice_.
            
            COTTON. But you must understand that marriage, my daughter, is a most
            reverend and serious matter which should be approached in a manner
            fittingly considerate of its grave responsibility.
            
            BETTY. [_Thoughtfully._] Truly reverend and most serious, father
            [_looking up roguishly_], but I like not so much of the grave about it.
            
            COTTON. [_Continuing._] I fear thou lookest upon the matter too lightly.
            It is not seemly to treat such a momentous occasion thus flippantly.
            
            BETTY. [_Protesting._] Nay, father, why consider it at all? Marriage is
            yet a great way off. Mayhap I shall never leave thee.
            
            COTTON. Thou little thinkest that I may be suddenly called on to leave
            _thee_. The Good Word cautions us to boast not ourselves of the morrow,
            for we know not what a day may bring forth.
            
            BETTY. [_Dropping her knitting._] Father, thou art not feeling well.
            Perhaps----
            
            COTTON. Nay, child, be not alarmed. 'Tis but a most necessary lesson to
            be learned and laid up in the heart. I will not always be with thee and
            I would like to be comfortably assured of thy future welfare before I
            go.
            
            BETTY. [_Picking her knitting up._] Be comfortably assured, then, I
            prithee; I have no fears.
            
            COTTON. [_Bringing his arm down forcibly on the arm of the chair._] Aye!
            There it is. Thou hast no fears. Would that thou had'st some! [_Looks up
            at the portrait._] Had thy prudent and virtuous mother only lived to
            point the way, I might be spared this anxiety; but, beset by diverse
            difficulties in establishing the kingdom of God in this country, and
            sorely harassed by many hardships and by evil men, I fear me I have not
            propounded to thee much that I ought.
            
            BETTY. In what then is mine education lacking? Have I not all that is
            fitting and proper for a maiden to know?
            
            COTTON. [_Perplexed._] I know not. I have done my best, but thou hast
            not the proper attitude of mind befitting a maiden about to enter the
            married estate.
            
            BETTY. [_Protesting._] Nay, but I am not about to enter the married
            estate.
            
            COTTON. It is time.
            
            BETTY. [_Mockingly pleading._] Entreat me not to leave thee, father, nor
            forsake thee; for whither thou goest I will go, and whither----
            
            COTTON. [_Interrupting sternly._] Betty! It ill befitteth a daughter of
            mine to quote the Scriptures with such seeming irreverence.--I would not
            be parted from thee, yet I would that thou wert promised to some godly
            and upright soul that would guide thee yet more surely in the paths of
            righteousness. There be many such.
            
            BETTY. Yea, too many.
            
            COTTON. What meanest thou?
            
            BETTY. One were one too many when I would have none.
            
            COTTON. [_Shaking his head._] Ah. Betty, Betty! When wilt thou be
            serious? There is a goodly youth among the friends surrounding thee whom
            I have often marked, both on account of his godly demeanor and simple
            wisdom.
            
            BETTY. [_Nodding._] Yea, simple.
            
            COTTON. I speak of Adonijah Wigglesworth, a most estimable young
            gentleman, an acquaintance whom thou would'st do well to cultivate.
            
            BETTY. Yea, cultivate.
            
            COTTON. What thinkest thou?
            
            BETTY. A sod too dense for any ploughshare. My wit would break in the
            turning.
            
            COTTON. His is a strong nature, born to drive and not be driven. There
            is not such another, nay, not in the whole of Boston.
            
            BETTY. Nay. I have lately heard there be many such!
            
            COTTON. [_Testily._] Mayhap thou wouldst name a few.
            
            BETTY. [_Musingly, holds up her left hand with fingers outspread._] Aye,
            that I can. [_Checks off one on the little finger._] There be Marcus
            Ainslee----
            
            COTTON. A goodly youth that hath an eye for books.
            
            BETTY. One eye, sayest thou? Nay, four; and since I am neither morocco
            bound nor edged with gilt, let us consign him to the shelf wherein he
            findeth fullest compensation.
            
            COTTON. How now? A man of action, then, should appeal to thy brash
            tastes. What sayest thou to Jeremiah Wadsworth?
            
            BETTY. Too brash and rash for me [_checking off that candidate on the
            next finger_], and I'll have none of him. There's Percy Wayne.
            
            COTTON. Of the bluest blood in Boston.
            
            BETTY. Yet that be not everything [_checks off another finger_]--and
            Jonas Appleby----
            
            COTTON. He hath an eye to worldly goods----
            
            BETTY. [_Quickly._] Especially the larder. To marry him would be an
            everlasting round between the tankard and the kettle. [_Checks him
            off._] Nay, let me look yet farther--James Endicott. [_Checking._]
            
            COTTON. Aye, there might be a lad for thee; birth, breeding, a
            well-favored countenance, and most agreeable.
            
            BETTY. Yea, most agreeable--unto himself. 'Twere a pity to disturb such
            unanimity. Therefore, let us pass on. Take Charles Manning, an you
            please----
            
            COTTON. It pleaseth me not! I know the ilk; his father before him a
            devoted servant of the devil and King Charles. With others of his kind
            he hath brought dissension among the young men of Harvard, many of whom
            are dedicated to the service of the Lord, with his wicked apparel and
            ungodly fashion of wearing long hair after the manner of Russians and
            barbarous Indians. Many there be with him brought up in such pride as
            doth in no ways become the service of the Lord. The devil himself hath
            laid hold on our young men, so that they do evaporate senseless,
            useless, noisy impertinency wherever they may be; and now it has e'en
            got out in the pulpits of the land, to the great grief and fear of many
            godly hearts.
            
                 [_He starts to his feet and paces the floor._
            
            BETTY. [_Standing upright._] But Charles----
            
            COTTON. [_Interrupting._] Mention not that scapegrace in my hearing.
            
            BETTY. [_Still persisting._] But, father, truly thou knowest not----
            
            COTTON. [_Almost savagely, while_ BETTY _retreats to a safe distance_.]
            Name him not. I will not have it. Compared with Adonijah he is a reed
            shaken in the winds, whereas Adonijah resembleth a tree planted by the
            river of waters.
            
            BETTY. [_Who has been looking out of the window._] Converse of the devil
            and thou wilt behold his horns. Even now he approacheth the knocker.
            
                 [_The knocker sounds._
            
            COTTON. [_Sternly._] Betake thyself to thine own chamber with thine
            unseemly tongue, which so ill befitteth a maid.
            
                 [BETTY _is very demure, with head slightly bent and downcast eyes;
                 but the moment_ COTTON _turns she glances roguishly after his
                 retreating form; then while her glance revolves about the room, she
                 starts slightly as her gaze falls upon the clock. A smile of
                 mischievous delight flits over her countenance as she tiptoes in_
                 COTTON'S _wake until the clock is reached_. COTTON, _unsuspecting,
                 meanwhile, proceeds to do his duty as host, with never a backward
                 glance. While he is out in the hall_ BETTY, _with a lingering smile
                 of triumph, climbs into the clock and cautiously peeks forth as her
                 father opens the door and ushers in_ ADONIJAH, _whereupon the door
                 softly closes_.
            
            ADONIJAH. Good-morrow, reverend sir.
            
            COTTON. Enter, and doubly welcome.
            
            ADONIJAH. I would inquire whether thy daughter Betty is within.
            
            COTTON. We were but speaking of thee as thy knock sounded. Betty will be
            here presently; she hath but retired for the moment. Remove thy wraps
            and make thyself in comfort.
            
                 [ADONIJAH _is a lean, lank, lantern-jawed individual, clad in the
                 conventional sober gray of the Puritan, with high-crowned hat, and
                 a fur tippet wound about his neck up to his ears. He removes the
                 hat and tippet and hands them to_ COTTON, _who carefully places
                 them upon the table; meanwhile_ ADONIJAH _looks appraisingly about
                 him and judiciously selects the armchair by the fire. He pauses a
                 moment to rub his hands before the blaze, and then gingerly relaxes
                 into the depths of the armchair, as though fearful his comfort
                 would give way ere fully attained._ COTTON _places a chair on the
                 other side of_ ADONIJAH _and is seated_.
            
            COTTON. And how is it with thee since I have seen thee last?
            
            ADONIJAH. My business prospereth [_mournfully_], but not so finely as it
            might well do.
            
                 [_The clock strikes four, but is unnoticed by the two men._
            
            COTTON. Thou hast suffered some great loss?
            
            ADONIJAH. But yes--and no--this matter of lending money hath many and
            grievous complications, not the least of which is the duplicity of the
            borrower. I but insist on the thirty pounds to the hundred as my due
            recompense, and when I demand it they respond not, but let my kindness
            lie under the clods of ingratitude. [_Straightening up, and speaking
            with conviction._] They shall come before the council. I will have what
            is mine own.
            
            COTTON. [_Righteously._] And it is not unbecoming of thee to demand it.
            I wist not what the present generation is coming to.
            
            ADONIJAH. They have no sense of the value of money. They know not how to
            demean themselves properly in due proportion to their worldly goods, as
            the Lord hath prospered them. There be many that have nothing and do
            hold their heads above us that be worthy of our possessions.
            
            COTTON. The wicked stand in slippery places. It will not always be thus.
            Judgment shall come upon them.
            
            ADONIJAH. Aye, let them fall. I for one have upheld them too far. They
            squander their means in riotous living, and walk not in the ways of
            their fathers.
            
            COTTON. There be many such--many such--but thou, my lad, thou art not
            one of the multitude. As I have often observed to my Betty, thou
            standest out as a most upright and God-fearing young man.
            
            ADONIJAH. [_Brimming over with self-satisfaction._] That have I ever
            sought to be.
            
            COTTON. An example that others would do well to imitate.
            
            ADONIJAH. [_All puffed up._] Nay, others value it not. They be envious
            of my good fortune.
            
            COTTON. A most prudent young man! Nay, be not so over-blushingly timid.
            Thou'rt too modest.
            
            ADONIJAH. [_His face falling._] But Betty--doth she regard me thus?
            
            COTTON. The ways of a maid are past finding out; but despair not. I
            think she hath thee much to heart, but, as the perverse heart of woman
            dictateth, behaveth much to the contrary.
            
            ADONIJAH. [_Brightening up as one with new hopes._] Thou thinkest----
            
            COTTON. [_Interrupting._] Nay, lad, I am sure of it. Betty was ever a
            dutiful daughter.
            
                 [_All unseen_, BETTY _peeks out mischievously_.
            
            ADONIJAH. But I mistrust me her heart is elsewhere.
            
            COTTON. Thou referr'st to young Manning without doubt. It can never be.
            'Tis but a passing fancy.
            
            ADONIJAH. Nay, but I fear Charles thinketh not so. I have been told in
            secret [_leaning forward confidentially_] by one that hath every
            opportunity to know, that he hath enjoined Goodman Shrewsbury to send
            for--[_impressively_] a ring!
            
            COTTON. [_Angered._] A ring, sayest thou?
            
            ADONIJAH. [_Nodding._] Aye, even so.
            
            COTTON. But he hath not signified such intention here to me.
            
            ADONIJAH. Then there are no grounds for his rash presumption?
            
            COTTON. Humph! Grounds! For a ring! Aye, there'll be no diabolical
            circle here for the devil to daunce in. I will question Betty thereon.
            [_Rises._] Do thou remain here and I will send her to thee. Oh, that he
            should offer daughter of mine a ring!
            
                 [COTTON _leaves the room_. ADONIJAH _leans back in his chair in
                 supreme contentment at the turn affairs have taken. The clamorous
                 knocker arouses him from his reverie. He gazes stupidly around. The
                 continued imperious tattoo on the knocker finally brings him to his
                 feet. He goes into the hall and opens the door. His voice is
                 heard._
            
            ADONIJAH. [_Frostily._] Good-afternoon, Sir Charles, mine host is
            absent.
            
            CHARLES. [_Stepping in._] My mission has rather to do with Mistress
            Betty. Is she in?
            
            ADONIJAH. [_Closing the hall door, and turning to_ CHARLES, _replies in
            grandiose hauteur_.] Mistress Betty is otherwise engaged, I would have
            thee know.
            
            CHARLES. Engaged? [_Bowing._] Your humble servant, I trust, hath the
            supreme pleasure of that engagement.
            
                 [_He glances inquiringly about the room, and places the hat on the
                 table beside that of_ ADONIJAH. _The two hats are as different as
                 the two men_: ADONIJAH'S _prim, Puritanic, severe_; CHARLES'S
                 _three-cornered, with a flowing plume_.
            
                 [CHARLES _is a handsome chap of goodly proportions, with a
                 straightforward air and a pleasant smile. He is dressed more after
                 the fashion of the cavaliers of Virginia, and wears a long wig with
                 flowing curls. The two men size each other up._
            
            ADONIJAH. [_Meaningly._] Her father will shortly arrive.
            
            CHARLES. [_Impatiently striding forth._] Devil take her father. 'Tis
            Mistress Betty I would see. Where is she?
            
                 [CHARLES _continues pacing the floor_. ADONIJAH, _shocked beyond
                 measure, turns his back on the offending_ CHARLES, _and with folded
                 arms and bowed head stands aside in profound meditation. The clock
                 door slowly opens and_ BETTY _cautiously peeks out_. CHARLES _stops
                 short and is about to begin a decided demonstration, when_ BETTY,
                 _with a warning glance toward_ ADONIJAH, _checks him with upraised
                 hand. The clock door closes and_ CHARLES _subsides into the
                 armchair with a comprehending grin of delight_. ADONIJAH _slowly
                 turns and faces_ CHARLES _with a melancholy air_.
            
            CHARLES. Prithee, why so sad?
            
                 [_The grin becomes a chuckle._
            
            
            ADONIJAH. I do discern no cause for such unrighteous merriment.
            
            CHARLES. 'Tis none the less for all of that. I take life as I find it,
            and for that matter so do they all, even thou. The difference be in the
            finding. [_Whistles._
            
            ADONIJAH. [_Uneasily._] It is time her father did arrive.
            
            CHARLES. Where then hath he been?
            
            ADONIJAH. He but went in search of Betty.
            
            CHARLES. Ah, then we'll wait.
            
                 [_He whistles, while_ ADONIJAH _moves uneasily about the room,
                 glancing every now and then at this disturbing element of his
                 peace, as if he would send him to kingdom come, if he only could_.
            
            ADONIJAH. [_After considerable toleration._] Waiting may avail thee
            naught.
            
            CHARLES. And thee? Nevertheless we'll wait. [_Whistles._
            
            ADONIJAH. [_Takes another turn or two and fetches up a counterfeit
            sigh._] Methinks, her father's quest be fruitless.
            
            CHARLES. [_Starting up._] Ah, then, let us go.
            
                 [ADONIJAH., _visibly relieved, sits down in the chair opposite_.
            
            CHARLES. [_Amused._] Nay? [_Sits down and relaxes._] Ah, then, we'll
            wait. [_Whistles._
            
            ADONIJAH. [_Troubled._] 'Tis certain Mistress Betty be not here.
            
            CHARLES. Nay, if she be not here, then I am neither here nor there. I
            would wager ten pounds to a farthing she be revealed in time if she but
            will it. Wilt take me up?
            
            ADONIJAH. It be not seemly so to stake thy fortune on a woman's whim.
            
            CHARLES. [_Laughs._] Thou'rt right on it. If she will, say I, for if she
            will she won't, and if she won't she will.
            
            ADONIJAH. False jargon! A woman has no will but e'en her father's as a
            maid, her husband's later still.
            
                 [_Enter_ COTTON, _who stops short on seeing_ CHARLES, _rallies
                 quickly, and proceeds_.
            
            COTTON. [_Stiffly._] Good-day to you, sir.
            
            CHARLES. [_Bowing; he has risen._] And to you, sire.
            
            COTTON. [_To_ ADONIJAH.] I am deeply grieved to report that Mistress
            Betty is not to be found.
            
                 [ADONIJAH. _steals a sly look of triumph at_ CHARLES.
            
            CHARLES. [_In mock solemnity._] I prithee present my deep regrets to
            Mistress Betty. I will call again.
            
            COTTON. God speed thee! [_And as_ CHARLES _takes his leave_ COTTON
            _places his hand affectionately upon_ ADONIJAH'S _shoulder, saying
            reassuringly_.] Come again, my son; Betty may not be afar off. I fain
            would have her soon persuaded of thy worth. Improve thy time.
            
            ADONIJAH. [_Beaming._] Good morrow, sir; I will.
            
                 [_As the door closes behind them_ COTTON _slowly walks toward the
                 fire, where he stands in complete revery. Still absorbed in thought
                 he walks slowly out the door at the right._ BETTY _peeks cautiously
                 out, but hearing footsteps quickly withdraws_. COTTON _re-enters
                 with hat on. He is talking to himself, reflectively._
            
            COTTON. Where can she be? Mayhap at Neighbor Ainslee's.
            
                 [_He goes hurriedly out through the hall door. The banging of the
                 outside door is heard. The clock door once more slowly opens and_
                 BETTY _peers forth, listening. The sound of a door opening causes
                 her to draw back. As the noise is further emphasized by approaching
                 footsteps, she pulls the clock door quickly to._ CHARLES _enters.
                 He looks inquiringly about, tosses his hat on the table, and goes
                 for the clock. He opens it with a gay laugh._ BETTY _steps forth
                 out of the clock, very much assisted by_ CHARLES.
            
            CHARLES. Blessed relief! Thou art in very truth, then, flesh and blood?
            
            BETTY. And what else should I be, forsooth?
            
            CHARLES. [_Laughing._] I marked thee for a mummy there entombed.
            
            BETTY. [_Disengaging her hand._] What? Darest thou?
            
            CHARLES. A lively mummy now thou art come to, whilst I [_sighs_]--I
            waited through the ages!
            
            BETTY. [_Laughingly._] A veritable monument of patient grief.
            
            CHARLES. And Adonijah----
            
            BETTY. Yea, verily, old Father Time but come to life. [_Mimics._] Thy
            waiting may avail thee naught.
            
            CHARLES. In truth, it may avail me naught; thy father may be back at any
            time, while I have much to say, sweet Betty----
            
            BETTY. [_Interrupting._] Nay, sweet Betty call me not.
            
            CHARLES. Dear Betty, then, the dearest----
            
            BETTY. [_Quickly._] Yea, call me dearest mummy, Hottentot, or what you
            will, just so it be not _sweet_, like Adonijah. It sickens me beyond
            expressing.
            
            CHARLES. Then, _sweet_ Betty thou art _not_, say rather sour Betty,
            cross Betty, mean Betty, bad Betty, mad Betty, sad Betty.
            
            BETTY. [_Suddenly dimpling._] Nay, glad Betty!
            
            CHARLES. Art then so glad? Wilt tell me why? In sooth, I know not
            whither to be glad, or sad, or mad. Sometimes I am but one, sometimes I
            am all three.
            
            BETTY. Wilt tell me why?
            
            CHARLES. [_Stepping closer and imprisoning her left hand._] Thou wilt
            not now escape it, for I will tell thee why, and mayhap this will aid
            me. [_Slips ring, which he has had concealed in his pocket, on her
            finger._] Hath this no meaning for thee?
            
            BETTY. [_Her eyes sparkling with mischief._] Aye, 'tis a diabolical
            circle for the devil to daunce in!
            
            CHARLES. [_In astonishment._] A what?
            
            BETTY. [_Slowly._] A diabolical circle for the devil to daunce in--so
            father saith. Likewise Adonijah.
            
            CHARLES. [_Weakly endeavoring to comprehend._] A diabolical circle--but
            what!--say it again, Betty.
            
            BETTY. [_Repeats slowly, emphasizing it with pointed finger._] A
            diabolical circle for the devil to daunce in.
            
            CHARLES. [_Throws back his head and laughs._] May I be the devil!
            
            BETTY. [_Shaking her finger at him._] Then daunce!
            
                 [_They take position, as though for a minuet. The knocker sounds._
                 BETTY _runs to the window_.
            
            BETTY. Aye, there's ADONIJAH at the knocker. Into the clock--hie
            thee--quick, quick!
            
            CHARLES. [_Reproachfully._] And would'st thou incarcerate me through the
            ages? [_Turns to the clock._] O timely sarcophagus!
            
                 [CHARLES _is smuggled into the clock, and_ BETTY _has barely enough
                 time to make a dash for the hat and conceal it behind her before
                 the door opens and in stalks_ ADONIJAH. _He looks about
                 suspiciously._ BETTY _faces him with the hat held behind her. He
                 removes his hat and tippet and lays them on the table._
            
            ADONIJAH. Methought I heard a sound of many feet.
            
            BETTY. [_Looking down._] Two feet have I; no more, no less.
            
            ADONIJAH. [_Dryly._] Aye, two be quite sufficient.
            
            BETTY. An thou sayest the word, they yet can beat as loud a retreat as
            an whole regiment.
            
            ADONIJAH. Thou dost my meaning misconstrue.
            
            BETTY. Construe it then, I prithee.
            
            ADONIJAH. I came not here to vex----
            
            BETTY. Then get thee hence. [_He steps forward._ BETTY _steps back_.]
            But not behind me, Satan.
            
            ADONIJAH. [_Coming closer._] And yet thou driv'st me to it.
            
            BETTY. [_Backing off._] Indeed, thou hast a nature born to _drive_ and
            not be driven.
            
            ADONIJAH. [_Highly complimented._] So be it, yet I scarce had hoped that
            thou would'st notice. [_Advancing._] Born to drive, thou sayest, not be
            driven.
            
            BETTY. [_Retreating._] Thou hast said it, born to _drive_. But what to
            drive I have not said. That knowledge hath my father yet concealed.
            
            ADONIJAH. [_Eagerly._] Thy father, then, hath told thee----
            
            BETTY. [_Who is retreating steadily across the room._] Thou wert born to
            _drive_!
            
                 [_Strikes settee and goes down on the hat._ ADONIJAH _seats himself
                 beside_ BETTY. BETTY _is of necessity forced to remain--on the
                 hat_. ADONIJAH _slides arm along the back of the settee. The clock
                 door strikes erratically. He jerks his arm back and gazes in the
                 direction of the clock. The clock hands wigwag._ ADONIJAH _stares
                 abstractedly and passes his hand over his forehead in a dazed
                 manner_.
            
            BETTY. [_Solicitously._] What aileth thee?
            
            ADONIJAH. [_Still staring._] The time!
            
            BETTY. [_Stifles a yawn._] It doth grow late.
            
            ADONIJAH. But not consistently; it changeth.
            
            BETTY. 'Twas ever so with time.
            
            ADONIJAH. [_Reminiscently._] Of a certainty they moved.
            
            BETTY. Yea, verily, 'tis not uncommon.
            
            ADONIJAH. But backwards!
            
            BETTY. [_Joyfully._] Why, then, my prayers are answered. How often I
            have prayed them thus to move! Yet hath it never come to pass.
            
            ADONIJAH. Nay, had'st thou seen----
            
            BETTY. Prithee calm thyself. Thou'rt ill.
            
            ADONIJAH. [_Steals his arm along the back of the settee and moves over
            closer._] Sweet Betty! [BETTY _looks away with a wry face_.] Thy
            indifference in no wise blinds me to thy conception of my true value.
            [BETTY _sits up, round-eyed_.] There was a time when I despaired--[_The
            clock again strikes wildly. The hands drop and rise as before._ ADONIJAH
            _excitedly points at the clock_.] Again! Did'st mark it? Something doth
            ail the clock!
            
            BETTY. Yea, truly thou art ill. The clock behaveth much more to the
            point than thou.
            
            ADONIJAH. [_Tearing his gaze from the clock._] As I was on the point of
            saying--[_glances at the clock_] thy father hath given--[_another
            glance_] me to understand--[_with eye on the clock he hitches up
            closer_] that thou art not averse to mine affections----
            
                 [_As he attempts to put his arm around_ BETTY _the clock strikes a
                 tattoo and startles him excitedly to his feet, as the hands travel
                 all the way round_.
            
            ADONIJAH. [_Pointing._] Now look! Mark the time!
            
                 [COTTON _enters_.
            
            COTTON. Tarry yet awhile, my son, the time doth not prevent thee.
            
            ADONIJAH. Tarry? Time doth not prevent? Little knowest thou! [_Gazes
            abstractedly about. Sights the ring on_ BETTY'S _finger, who in
            excitement has forgotten to keep her hands behind her back_.] Aye, there
            it is, the diabolical circle. It is a charm. It harms her not, while all
            about me is askew. Whence came she here? [_Points at_ BETTY.] She
            neither came nor went, and yet she was not there and now she is. A manly
            form did enter. Yet hath vanished into thin air. Yea, verily, it was
            none other than the devil himself in one of his divers forms, of which
            he hath aplenty. The very clock indulgeth in unseemly pranks. A strange
            influence hangs over me. I cannot now abide. I must depart from hence.
            My conscience bids me go.
            
            COTTON. [_Striving to detain him._] Hold! Thou'rt mad!
            
            BETTY. Nay, father, he is ill.
            
            ADONIJAH. [_Wildly._] Aye, if I be mad, thy daughter be to blame. The
            spell did come upon me. I have seen strange things.
            
            COTTON. What meanest thou?
            
            ADONIJAH. [_Pointing at_ BETTY, _who regards him wonderingly_.] Thy
            daughter is a witch!
            
            BETTY. [_Runs to_ COTTON.] Oh, father!
            
            COTTON. [_Consoles_ BETTY; _thunders at_ ADONIJAH.] What? Darest thou to
            being forth such an accusation?
            
            ADONIJAH. Aye, while I yet have strength to order mine own will. We
            shall see what we shall see when the fires leap round the stake. All the
            diabolical circles the devil may invent or his helpmeets acquire will be
            of small avail when the leaping tongues of flame curl round you, false
            servant of the devil. I can delay no longer. I will repair to the
            council at once, and report what I have seen.
            
                 [BETTY _faints away_. COTTON _is at once all paternal solicitude_.
                 ADONIJAH _gazes in stupefaction. All unobserved_ CHARLES _slips out
                 of the clock. Finally_ ADONIJAH, _as_ BETTY _shows signs of
                 reviving, turns himself away, only to find himself face to face
                 with_ CHARLES. ADONIJAH _stops dead in his tracks, absolutely
                 nonplussed_.
            
            CHARLES. Thou goest to the council? Thou lackest evidence. Behold the
            devil an' thou wilt.
            
                 [ADONIJAH'S _jaw drops. He stares unbelievingly._ COTTON _looks up
                 in surprise as_ CHARLES _continues_.
            
            CHARLES. An' thou goest to the council with such a message, the devil
            will dog thy very footsteps. And match word of thine with word of truth
            in such a light that thine own words shall imprison thee in the stocks
            over Sunday.
            
                 [ADONIJAH _recovers from his temporary abstraction, and seizing his
                 hat and tippet, tears out the door as if a whole legion of imps
                 were in full pursuit_. CHARLES _contemptuously turns on his heel
                 and goes over to_ BETTY, _who is now clinging to her father's arm_.
            
            BETTY. [_Faintly._] They will not burn me for a witch?
            
            CHARLES. [_Savagely._] Aye, let them try it an they will.
            
            COTTON. [_Hotly._] Aye--let them! [_Then starting suddenly with a new
            thought._] But how cam'st thou here? Yea, verily, it seemeth to me thou
            did'st materialize out of thin air.
            
                 [_Surveys_ CHARLES _with piercing scrutiny_.
            
            CHARLES. Nay, see through me an thou can'st. Thou wilt find me a most
            material shadow, the like of which no eye hath ever pierced. 'Twas not
            out of the air, but out of yonder clock that I materialized.
            
            BETTY. Yea, father, I put him there.
            
            COTTON. [_Going to the clock and opening it._] Of a truth, the evidence,
            all told, is here. Thou wert of a certainty in the clock. [_Takes out
            the detached pendulum. Steps back and surveys the timepiece, whose hands
            clearly indicate a time long passed or not yet come._] And as far as
            pendulums are concerned [_looking ruefully at the one in his hand_],
            thou certainly wert no improve----
            
            CHARLES. Aye, that I'll warrant. And may I never more be called to
            fulfil such position; the requirements be far too exacting for one of my
            build and constitution.
            
            COTTON. But what extremity hath induced thee to take up thine abode in
            such a place?
            
                 [_Lays the pendulum aside and gives_ CHARLES _his entire
                 attention_.
            
            CHARLES. Why, that came all in the course of events as I take it. When I
            returned a short time ago, hard upon mine heels came Adonijah; and,
            being loath either to leave the field or share it, I hid within the
            clock. Once there, the temptation to help time in covering its course
            grew strong upon me in the hope that Adonijah, misled by the lateness of
            the hour, would soon depart. Only I looked not for such a departure.
            Judge me not too harshly, sire, for I love thy daughter, and if thou
            wilt give thy consent to our marriage I will do all that becometh a man
            to deserve such treasure.
            
            COTTON. I like not thy frivolous manner of wearing hair that is not
            thine own; it becomes thee not. And I strongly mistrust thine attitude
            toward the more serious things of life.
            
            CHARLES. If my wig standeth between me and my heart's desire, why, I'll
            have no wig at all. [_He pulls the wig off and tosses it aside._ BETTY,
            _with a little cry, picks it up and smooths its disarranged curls_.] And
            as for mine outlook on life, I promise thee that hath but matched the
            outer trappings, and can be doffed as quickly. I am as serious beneath
            all outward levity as any sober-minded judge, and can act accordingly.
            
            COTTON. See to it that thou suit the action to those words. My heart is
            strangely moved toward thee, yet I would ponder the matter more deeply.
            [_Turns to_ BETTY, _who has been absent-mindedly twirling the curls on
            the wig_.] And where is thy voice, my daughter? Thou art strangely
            silent--[_as an afterthought_] for the once. But it is of small wonder,
            since thou hast had enough excitement for one evening. Methinks that
            scoundrel, Adonijah, needeth following up. Do thou remain with Betty,
            Charles, and I will hasten after him.
            
            CHARLES. Nay, thou need'st not trouble thyself regarding Adonijah. He
            hath much too wholesome a regard for the ducking-stool to cause further
            mischief.
            
            COTTON. Nevertheless, I will away to the council and make sure. [_He
            plants his hat on his head and departs._
            
            CHARLES. [_Turning to_ BETTY, _who has dropped the wig on the settee,
            and who is now gazing demurely at the floor_.] And now to finish up
            where we left off. The devil hath led us a merrier dance than we
            suspected. Thou hast not truly given answer to the question I have asked
            of thee.
            
            BETTY. What more of an answer would'st thou yet require?
            
            CHARLES. Why, I have yet had none at all.
            
            BETTY. Must tell thee further?
            
            CHARLES. [_Gravely._] Thou must.
            
            BETTY. [_Mischievously._] Then--put the question once again.
            
            CHARLES. Thou knowest the question, an thou wilt.
            
            BETTY. An' thou knowest the answer.
            
                 [CHARLES _takes her in his arms_.
            
            
            BETTY. [_Holding up her hand so that the ring sparkles._] Look,
            Charles--the diabolical circle!
