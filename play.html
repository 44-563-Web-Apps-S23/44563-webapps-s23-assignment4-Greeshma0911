        <h1>Greeshma Jale snips a play</h1>
        <h3>Name of the play: THE DIABOLICAL CIRCLE </h3>
        <h3>Author: BEULAH BORNSTEAD</h3>
        
     <h3 class="cotton">COTTON</h3> <p class="speech">But you must understand that marriage, my daughter, is a most
     reverend and serious matter which should be approached in a manner
     fittingly considerate of its grave responsibility.</p>
     
     <h3 class="betty">BETTY</h3> <p class="direction">[_Thoughtfully._]</p> <p class="speech">Truly reverend and most serious, father,</p>
     <p class="direction">[_looking up roguishly_]</p><p class="speech">but I like not so much of the grave about it.</p>
     
     <h3 class="cotton">COTTON</h3><p class="direction">[_Continuing._]</p><p class ="speech">I fear thou lookest upon the matter too lightly.
     It is not seemly to treat such a momentous occasion thus flippantly.</p>
     
     <h3 class="betty"> BETTY </h3><p class="direction">[_Protesting._] </p><p class="speech">Nay, father, why consider it at all? Marriage is
     yet a great way off. Mayhap I shall never leave thee.</p>
     
     <h3 class="cotton">COTTON </h3><p class="speech">Thou little thinkest that I may be suddenly called on to leave
     _thee_. The Good Word cautions us to boast not ourselves of the morrow,
     for we know not what a day may bring forth.</p>
     
     <h3 class="betty">BETTY</h3><p class="direction"> [_Dropping her knitting._] </p><p class="speech">Father, thou art not feeling well.
     Perhaps----</p>
     
     <h3 class="cotton">COTTON</h3><p class="speech">Nay, child, be not alarmed. 'Tis but a most necessary lesson to
     be learned and laid up in the heart. I will not always be with thee and
     I would like to be comfortably assured of thy future welfare before I
     go.</p>
     
     <h3 class="betty">BETTY</h3><p class="direction">[_Picking her knitting up._] </p><p class="speech">Be comfortably assured, then, I
     prithee; I have no fears.</p>
     
     <h3 class="cotton">COTTON</h3> <p class="direction">[_Bringing his arm down forcibly on the arm of the chair._]</p><p class="speech"> Aye!
     There it is. Thou hast no fears. Would that thou had'st some! </p><p class="direction">[_Looks up
     at the portrait._] </p><p class="speech">Had thy prudent and virtuous mother only lived to
     point the way, I might be spared this anxiety; but, beset by diverse
     difficulties in establishing the kingdom of God in this country, and
     sorely harassed by many hardships and by evil men, I fear me I have not
     propounded to thee much that I ought.</p>
     
     <h3 class="betty">BETTY</h3><p class="speech"> In what then is mine education lacking? Have I not all that is
     fitting and proper for a maiden to know?</p>
     
     <h3 class="cotton">COTTON </h3><p class="direction">[_Perplexed._]</p> <p class="speech">I know not. I have done my best, but thou hast
     not the proper attitude of mind befitting a maiden about to enter the
     married estate.</p>
     
     <h3 class="betty">BETTY</h3><p class="direction">[_Protesting._] </p><p class="speech">Nay, but I am not about to enter the married
     estate.</p> 
     
     <h3 class="cotton">COTTON</h3><p class="speech">It is time.</p>
     
     <h3 class="betty">BETTY</h3><p class="direction">[_Mockingly pleading._]</p><p class="speech">Entreat me not to leave thee, father, nor
     forsake thee; for whither thou goest I will go, and whither---</p>
