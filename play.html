          THE DIABOLICAL CIRCLE


          SCENE: _The living-room in the Mather home in Boston._
     
          TIME: _About 1700, an evening in early autumn._
     
          _The stage represents the living-room of the Mather home. A large
          colonial fireplace is seen down-stage left, within which stand huge
          brass andirons. To one side hangs the bellows, with the tongs near
          by, while above, underneath the mantelpiece, is suspended an old
          flint-lock rifle. On both ends of the mantel are brass
          candlesticks, and hanging directly above is an old-fashioned
          portrait of Betty's mother. There are two doors, one leading into
          the hall at centre left, the other, communicating with the rest of
          the house, up-stage right. A straight high-backed settee is
          down-stage right, while in the centre back towers an old
          grandfather's clock.[K] To the left of the clock is the window,
          cross-barred and draped with flowered chintz. An old-fashioned
          table occupies the corner between the window and the hall door.
          Here and there are various straight-backed chairs of Dutch origin.
          Rag rugs cover the floor._
     
          _As the curtain rises_ COTTON MATHER _is seated in a large armchair
          by the fire, with_ BETTY _on a stool at his feet, with her
          knitting_.
     
          COTTON, _his hair already touched with the whitening frost of many
          a severe New England winter, is grave and sedate. Very much
          exercised with the perils of this life, and serenely contemplative
          of the life to come, he takes himself and the world about him very
          seriously._
     
          _Not so with_ MISTRESS BETTY. _Outwardly demure, yet inwardly
          rebellious against the straitened conventions of the times, she
          dimples over with roguish merriment upon the slightest
          provocation._
     
          _As we first see them_ COTTON _is giving_ BETTY _some timely
          advice_.
     
     COTTON. But you must understand that marriage, my daughter, is a most
     reverend and serious matter which should be approached in a manner
     fittingly considerate of its grave responsibility.
     
     BETTY. [_Thoughtfully._] Truly reverend and most serious, father
     [_looking up roguishly_], but I like not so much of the grave about it.
     
     COTTON. [_Continuing._] I fear thou lookest upon the matter too lightly.
     It is not seemly to treat such a momentous occasion thus flippantly.
     
     BETTY. [_Protesting._] Nay, father, why consider it at all? Marriage is
     yet a great way off. Mayhap I shall never leave thee.
     
     COTTON. Thou little thinkest that I may be suddenly called on to leave
     _thee_. The Good Word cautions us to boast not ourselves of the morrow,
     for we know not what a day may bring forth.
     
     BETTY. [_Dropping her knitting._] Father, thou art not feeling well.
     Perhaps----
     
     COTTON. Nay, child, be not alarmed. 'Tis but a most necessary lesson to
     be learned and laid up in the heart. I will not always be with thee and
     I would like to be comfortably assured of thy future welfare before I
     go.
     
     BETTY. [_Picking her knitting up._] Be comfortably assured, then, I
     prithee; I have no fears.
     
     COTTON. [_Bringing his arm down forcibly on the arm of the chair._] Aye!
     There it is. Thou hast no fears. Would that thou had'st some! [_Looks up
     at the portrait._] Had thy prudent and virtuous mother only lived to
     point the way, I might be spared this anxiety; but, beset by diverse
     difficulties in establishing the kingdom of God in this country, and
     sorely harassed by many hardships and by evil men, I fear me I have not
     propounded to thee much that I ought.
     
     BETTY. In what then is mine education lacking? Have I not all that is
     fitting and proper for a maiden to know?
     
     COTTON. [_Perplexed._] I know not. I have done my best, but thou hast
     not the proper attitude of mind befitting a maiden about to enter the
     married estate.
     
     BETTY. [_Protesting._] Nay, but I am not about to enter the married
     estate.
     
     COTTON. It is time.
     
     BETTY. [_Mockingly pleading._] Entreat me not to leave thee, father, nor
     forsake thee; for whither thou goest I will go, and whither----
